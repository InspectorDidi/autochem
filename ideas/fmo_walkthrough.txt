## assigning a group
- loop over distances
- if distance < cutoff
	- if distance < vdw separation, consider them connected
		- assign the same number to each atom
		- add bonds between the two atoms
	- else if atom i is assigned and not atom j
		- give atom j a different number 
	- else if atom j is assigned and not atom i
		- give atom i a different number
	- else:
		- give atom i a different number

- each new simulation must be run in a new directory


in.filename 

- input file
- read line-by-line; the order of commands matters
- if a command uses other data, the other piece of data must be written first

file.dat 

- data pertinent to the system being simulated
- read into the input file (read_data file.dat)



boundary: p = periodic; atoms disappear and reappear on other side
					f = fixed; atoms disappear when moving out of sim window
					s = shrink-wrapped; sim window/cell expands to fit content

Create gif for geometry optimisations? 
  - store energies and coordinates at each point. Not too hard really, just
    create lists for the energy values and coords, and store coords as a list
    of lists, then iterate through and show them in a package. 
  - Same idea for the vibrations, store coords at each step, with the
    intensities. Like Anh's script

  - LOG RESULTS IN A FILE IN THE HOME DIR- add path 

  PATH | ERROR | RESUBMITTED
                    Y/N
  - If error, make new xyz (rerun.xyz) and new inp/job (rerun.inp, rerun.job).
    Make this so that if rerun.xyz in dir, name it rerun2.xyz, and so on.
  - Ask if want to resubmit (if path, dirs, files in os.walk: run rerun.job
    - Make sure that if rerun.job in dir, don't rerun the original inputs
      (explicitly name the job as rerun[0-9].job) --> again, only run the
      latest rerun[0-9], don't rerun the lower numbers, if there are multiple
      repeats. (if rerun[0-9]- sort according to max, then run array[0])

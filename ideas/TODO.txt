# TODO

Create gif for geometry optimisations? 
  - store energies and coordinates at each point. Not too hard really, just
    create lists for the energy values and coords, and store coords as a list
    of lists, then iterate through and show them in a package. 
  - Same idea for the vibrations, store coords at each step, with the
    intensities. Like Anh's script. Then view with a plotnine graph. Import
into virtualenv, and save a local copy of the scripts. Same with numpy. So we
just need to import my package, with no other dependencies??

- for command line arguments:

Place all scripts in a scripts directory

Create a menu:
1. Create inputs recursively
2. Obtain results recursively
3. Get frequencies recursively
...

Call for 1: run scripts/inputs.py
Call for 2: run scripts/results.py

#SCRIPT IDEAS

- Place all xys in one dir, then create a tree of subdirs, with the job desired
  (could be gamess, psi4, lammps- for the ab initio jobs, with frags in subdir
if necessary). Files called opt.inp, so need to create a tree with a naming
system.



Files(in one dir):
choline_acetate_1.xyz
choline_acetate_2.xyz
choline_acetate_3.xyz
c4mim_acetate

Then just a scp of the files from local to supercomp.
Then call run from the parent dir, which will work recursively



- GAMESS/PSI4 JOBS
- GAMESS/PSI4 RESULTS

- CHECK FILES FOR COMPLETION
  - If error in the run, create error.txt
    - logging the actual error
    - if geom opt, how many iterations (log the energies and iteration)
    - plot a graph of energy against iteration num (plotnine)
      - if levels out, then finished (for scf methods, such as MP2, no energy
        change if converged)  
      - easily check how far through we are
    - layout:
      ERROR 
      GRAPH
      DATA

  - LOG RESULTS IN A FILE IN THE HOME DIR- add path 

  PATH | ERROR | RESUBMITTED
                    Y/N
  - If error, make new xyz (rerun.xyz) and new inp/job (rerun.inp, rerun.job).
    Make this so that if rerun.xyz in dir, name it rerun2.xyz, and so on.
  - Ask if want to resubmit (if path, dirs, files in os.walk: run rerun.job
    - Make sure that if rerun.job in dir, don't rerun the original inputs
      (explicitly name the job as rerun[0-9].job) --> again, only run the
      latest rerun[0-9], don't rerun the lower numbers, if there are multiple
      repeats. (if rerun[0-9]- sort according to max, then run array[0])








## ADD OPTION FOR LOCAL ASSIGNMENT IN PSI4 INPUT

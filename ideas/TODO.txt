# TODO

Create gif for geometry optimisations? 
  - store energies and coordinates at each point. Not too hard really, just
    create lists for the energy values and coords, and store coords as a list
    of lists, then iterate through and show them in a package. 
  - Same idea for the vibrations, store coords at each step, with the
    intensities. Like Anh's script. Then view with a plotnine graph. Import
into virtualenv, and save a local copy of the scripts. Same with numpy. So we
just need to import my package, with no other dependencies??

- for command line arguments:

Place all scripts in a scripts directory

Create a menu:
1. Create inputs recursively
2. Obtain results recursively
3. Get frequencies recursively
...

Call for 1: run scripts/inputs.py
Call for 2: run scripts/results.py

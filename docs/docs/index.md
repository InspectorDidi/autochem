# Welcome to the autochem documentation

Python software to automate the jobs of a computational chemist.
Currently set up to enable easy creation of GAMESS-US, Gaussian, Psi4
and Orca calculations, and post-processing of the subsequent results.

Abilities include:
- automatic input and job file creation

- 
energies
geometries
intermolecular hydrogen bond lengths
vibrations
fluorescence data
geodesic charges
homo-lumo gaps
Automatic analysis of results
interaction energies
purely ionic systems
mixed ionic/neutral species
calculates free energies

## General usage

Although the software can be fully utilised with python scripts, a command line
interface is the easiest way to use the package.

The `autochem` command gives you the cap
